# To future readers of this repository (ISE ICE)
&ensp; Hello this is the author and contributor of this repository on data structure and algorithms. This repository was made to share ideas and solution to some problems provided by the professor (Note that I won't be saving or sharing the actual papers as respect for the professor's intellectual work but I do think he will provide you with some in MyCourseVille). 

&ensp; I want to give some tips on how to do the exams to get good score and tell some of my own mistakes.<br>
1. Don't solely focus on the code itself. The exams as you know is written one. You must be able to explain concepts clearly and in detail assume that the reader only know the basics.
2. Prepare good writing equipment. write with pen draw with pencil, I tried to used only pencils and that ended badly.
3. Read the prompt well don't just scan.
4. Always account for fringe and extreme cases. For example null inputs, empty arrays, only one element arrays. They are the most overlooked and the first thing the professor tests on.
5. In code always write guard cluases against incorrect inputs, unless the prompt says to ignore them.
6. Every assumption made should be stated clearly.
7. Always think about how a data structure can be implemented using another data structure. Ex. Implementing queue using linked list, Implementing queues from stack, Implementing BST from CD linked list etc.
8. Always beware about time complexity it is one of the metric the professor will gauge your code.
9. Try to explain to yourself the code written. It is not enough to know what the code does, you must know what each statement does and why.
10. Practice a lot, I recommend [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to find exercises but do only easy to medium ones.
11. Don't give up and look at the solutions. Solving problem takes time.
