# midterms
Hello ICE friends! This is a java project I created for the midterm questions that the prof. gave out <br>
*Note: That not some methods might not be 100% as exams wants this is because the code is sometimes modified to allow for printing to the console*

# Packages and Imports?
Since I do not want multiple java file of the same class. I use packaging and import to make the file more readable 
Tldr; It's just java project stuff ignore them
